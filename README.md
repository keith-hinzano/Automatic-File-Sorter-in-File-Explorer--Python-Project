# Automatic-File-Sorter-in-File-Explorer--Python-Project

The Automatic File Sorter in File Explorer is a Python project designed to organize files into specific folders based on their file extensions. It works by scanning a specified directory (in this case, the Desktop), identifying files with certain extensions (e.g., .csv, .png, .txt), and moving them into corresponding folders such as "csv files," "image files," and "text files."

The program uses the os module to list and navigate through files, while the shutil module is employed to move files into the appropriate directories. If the target folders do not already exist, the script creates them automatically. This project demonstrates how Python can be used to automate file management tasks, helping users maintain a clean and organized file structure.
